	   <h1>i think the craziest one is that emperor who obsessed in clothing</h1>
       <p>"The Emperor's New Clothes" is a short tale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, about two weavers who promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that they say is invisible to those who are unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent â€“ while in reality,
       they make no clothes at all, making everyone believe the clothes are invisible to them. When the emperor parades before his subjects in his new "clothes", no one dares to say that they do not see any suit of clothes on him for fear that they will be seen as stupid.
        Finally, a child cries out, "But he isn't wearing anything at all!" The tale has been translated into over 100 languages.</p><br>
